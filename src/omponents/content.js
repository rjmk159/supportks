Dear Google Translation Team,

We are writing to request the inclusion of the Kashmiri language in institutionally approved Nastaliq script into Google's translation services, along with vocal support. Kashmiri, with more than 7.1 million speakers globally.

As per records available on different google platforms, Kashmiri is 5000 years old language and has strong literary traditions of about 8 Centuries. A few languages in the contemporary times enjoy the history of being so old. It is elder to many languages of the Indo Iranian and Indo Aryan origin. This language has a strong vocabulary system and can cater the demands of technological era. Besides Jammu and Kashmir, it is spoken in many parts of subcontinent and different parts of the world by Kashmiri diaspora. with rich literary traditions and strong cultural bonds this language has played a vital role in promoting human values ,peace ,interfaith harmony and high standards of literature writing .

Kashmiri, is deeply rooted in the rich cultural tapestry of the region. The absence of Kashmiri in Google's translation services, including vocal support, poses a significant linguistic and cultural barrier.

Kashmir is not only a region with a rich linguistic and cultural heritage but is also an officially recognized tourist destination. The inclusion of Kashmiri in Google Translate will enhance the tourist experience, foster better communication, and promote economic growth in the region. Tourists visiting Kashmir will have a more immersive experience, locals will be better able to cater to their needs, and this, in turn, will stimulate economic conditions in the area.

We are eager to collaborate with Google in this endeavor and are prepared to provide any necessary linguistic resources, documentation, and expert support to expedite the process of adding Kashmiri in Nastaliq script to Google Translate. Our community is dedicated and enthusiastic about contributing to this effort.

Furthermore, Kashmiri plays a vital role as a currency language in Jammu and Kashmir. Its inclusion in Google Translate, supported by vocal capabilities, will facilitate trade, commerce, and everyday transactions, contributing to the economic empowerment of millions of individuals who rely on this language for their livelihoods.

We're excited to help Google add Kashmiri to Translate, offering linguistic resources, expert support, and a prescribed grammar. Our dedicated community, with thousands of books, dictionaries, and a running newspaper, is enthusiastic about contributing to this effort

In our pursuit of this goal, we aim to garner support from the broader linguistic and language professional community. Here are a few email addresses of NGOâ€™s or individuals who will be able to provide invaluable assistance in this endeavor
